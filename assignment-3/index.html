              To make Masala Chicken, first thoroughly wash the chicken under running water. Now put it in some warm salted water and allow it to rest for 10 minutes and throw the water away and wash again. This helps to remove the smell of the chicken.Add oil and ghee in pan and heat over medium flame. When the oil is hot enough, add bay leaves and both the cardamom and cinnamon. Saute for a minute and then add finely chopped onion into it. Cook till onions turn pink. Then add the ginger-garlic paste. Fry for a minute and then add chicken pieces in it. Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes until it turns white.Quickly, add red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, cumin powder, and salt to taste. Stir to mix all the ingredients well with the chicken. Cook for a minute and then add finely chopped tomatoes and green chillies (slit and halved). Now reduce the flame and cook covered for 6-7 minutes and then uncovered till the chicken is browned.Add one cup water and cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-4 minutes until the chicken is tender and soft. Remove the lid and garnish with garam masala powder, coriander leaves, kasoori methi powder and cook on high flame till the oil separates. Your Masala Chicken or Chicken Masala is ready. Enjoy with butter naan, rice or roti.Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and the Caribbean. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.Indian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through.[1] In south India, coconut and curry leaves are also common ingredients.[2] Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti.This Dhaba Style Chicken Curry stands for every road trip we've had with our families. Same bold flavours, ready in under 45 minutes - it's hot and fragrant and is made with ground spices, onions and tomatoes. I've shared how to make this recipe in a traditional pressure cooker, instant pot and on the stovetop.I think I've finally nailed it. This Dhaba Style Chicken Curry is SO good. Its legit, as close as it gets to eating it in a dhaba. Spicy, fragrant with spices, big, bold flavours and really juicy pieces of chicken.
